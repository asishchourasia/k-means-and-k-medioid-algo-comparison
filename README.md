# Comparison of K-Means & K-Medioid Algorithms

*A Java Application For Comparing Two Main Clustering Algorithm ( K-Means &amp; K-Medioid ) In Data Mining Using Davies Bouldin Index.

Description :
  For GUI Here I used Java Swing.
  Here I used excel files for Data Sets. By using File Handling and some external Jar Libraries I connected excel file to our Java programs.
  
  
User Manual :
 
    
1. At first, choose any data set (given excel) file and keep it in any particular location in your computer.
2. Open Eclipse IDE.
3. Choose any Workspace.
4. Then, create new Java project with any name.
5. Then Right Click On Reference Libraries  Build path  Add External Jar’s (Download The External Jar Files from this link - http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.poi/poi/3.12-beta1 )
6. Add all the given java library files. (These external jars are needed for extracting data from the excel file)
7. Then create a package named codes
8. Then, paste all the source code files in that package.
9. Make sure that you have given the right location of the dataset file in all the program files.
10. At last, run the program, it will give you the clustering results.
